Waffle Emergency

Simple Game.

Red Bar across the top of the screen filling up. There is text in the bar describing how close to a waffle emergency it is.

In the center of the screen there will be a giant waffle button. Clicking it resets the waffle emergency bar. You are releasing the strategic waffle reserves.

To decorate the rest of the screen there will be other controls on a control panel with waffle related things like maple syrup levels. Fruit adders, etc. Might change styles or prompt humorous things but can just be window dressing if need be.
